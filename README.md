## 🧠 Completed Work

### 🟢 Beginner Level

In this level, I focused on understanding the fundamentals of **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and simple regression modeling** using Python.

---

### 🧩 Task 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning

* Loaded and explored the dataset using **pandas**.
* Cleaned missing values, handled duplicates, and removed outliers.
* Generated descriptive statistics to understand the data distribution.
* Visualized trends and relationships using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
* Exported the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

---

### 📈 Task 2: Simple Linear Regression

* Implemented a basic regression model to predict sales.
* Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
* Trained the model using **scikit-learn**.
* Evaluated model performance using:

  * R² Score
  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* Visualized actual vs. predicted results.

## ⚙️ Tools and Libraries Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook

## 🧭 Next Steps

* [ ] Complete **Intermediate Level** tasks (feature engineering and multiple regression).
* [ ] Work on **Advanced Level** tasks (model optimization, time series, deployment).
* [ ] Record and upload a **LinkedIn presentation video** explaining results and workflow.
* [ ] Update repository with new results and documentation.
